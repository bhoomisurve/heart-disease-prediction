#  Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the presence of heart disease using patient medical records. The model is trained using a synthetic yet realistic dataset.

## Dataset Features
- Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type
- RestingBP, Cholesterol, FastingBS
- MaxHR, Exercise Angina, Oldpeak, ST Slope, etc.

## Model
- RandomForestClassifier (scikit-learn)

## Results
- Accuracy: ~85-90%
- Evaluation: Classification Report, Correlation Heatmap

## How to Run
- Use `heart_dataset.csv` as input
- Run the `heart_disease.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter
